# Description
When I started learning Python I wanted to do a project. I started easy and created blackjack from the command line.
Running the `black_jack_from_command_line/main.py` file will allow you to play blackjack. 
It's not flawless, but hey, every ace starts as a rookie!

Later, during summertime, I felt bored and wanted to be able to create GUIs with Python. I started getting myself 
familiar with the tkinter library and decided to blow the dust of blackjack from command line project. Running the
`blackjack_with_tkinter/blackjack.py` will not only let you play but also feast your eyes on actual card graphics!

During my Master in Data Science, I got familiar with GitHub and even started to like it a lot. Then, I started 
brushing up my public repositories and decided that my first coding project should deserve a place here. Perhaps it will
even get a part 3.
